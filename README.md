# 📚Info Site Card Project (Static page)

Welcome to the **React Info Card** project! 🚀

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is an **Info Site** built as a card component that displays dummy information about React. An **Info Site** is a web page or application that provides detailed information on a specific topic or subject. In this case, the Info Site presents details about React in a visually appealing card format.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The primary goal of this project was to put into practice and enhance my React skills by:

- 🛠️ **Building Reusable Custom Components:** Creating components that can be reused across different parts of the project to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.
- 🔍 **Learning and Implementing JSX Syntax:** Getting hands-on experience with JSX (JavaScript XML), which is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML elements directly within JavaScript.

- 🗂️ **Organizing and Styling Components:** Structuring the components efficiently and applying styling to make the project visually appealing.

## 🎨 Figma Integration

A significant aspect of this project was using a design from **Figma**. This involved:

- 🖌️ **Learning Figma:** Understanding how to navigate and use Figma, a popular design tool, to get the most out of the design provided.

- 🔧 **Translating Figma Design to Code:** Converting the Figma design into a working React project, ensuring that the final site closely matches the original design.

## 🧪 Testing My React Skills

Overall, this project served as a practical test of my React skills, challenging me to build a functional, styled, and user-friendly Info Site. It was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of React, JSX, and Figma while also building something cool! 💻✨
